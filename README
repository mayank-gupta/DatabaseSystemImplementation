This is a relational database system implementation in C++.
It was an academic project I did with my friend last year. It runs many SQL like
queries like SELECT, CREATE, SUM etc.

The code is written in a little amateurish way as I was still learning at that 
time.

To Compile:
  Run make in the directory

To Run
  ./dbs.out

You can create a table, insert values and select. You need to have bison and flex installed
to compile the program successfully.

NOTE: This program is only built for linux environment.
